# About the project

1. This is my first mini project on web development purely based on **HTML5** and **CSS**. 

2. I designed and developed a responsive and visually appealing web page using core web technologies â€” **HTML5** and **CSS**.

3. The project focuses on clean layout design, proper semantic structuring, and user-friendly styling. It helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and understand the importance of design principles, responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility.
